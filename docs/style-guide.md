# Documentation Style Guide

This guide keeps RegimeFlow documentation consistent, clear, and easy to maintain.

## Voice and Tone
- Use second person ("you") and active voice.
- Prefer short sentences and concrete verbs.
- Avoid marketing language; be direct and factual.

## Structure
- One topic per page.
- Lead with a short summary of what the page covers.
- Use sentence-case headings.
- Keep headings specific and scannable.

## Code and Commands
- Use fenced code blocks with a language tag when possible.
- Show complete commands users can copy/paste.
- If order matters, number the steps.

## Links
- Use descriptive link text (avoid "click here").
- Link to the most authoritative source available.

## Accessibility
- Avoid "above/below" references.
- Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning.
- Provide alt text for diagrams and images.

## Maintenance
- Update docs alongside code changes.
- Remove stale sections quickly.
- Prefer small, accurate docs over large outdated docs.
